I am Victor Almendros-Abad, a postdoctoral researcher at the Observatory of Palermo (Italy).

I was born in Valladolid (Spain), and studied there a Bachelor in Physics. I obtained my master's degree in Space Science and Technology by the University of the Basque Country (Bilbao, Spain), where I worked with Ricardo Hueso modeling convective dust storms in Mars. I then moved to the University of Lisbon (Portugal) for my PhD where I worked with Koraljka Muzic and Andr√© Moitinho.  My [PhD thesis](https://repositorio.ulisboa.pt/entities/publication/229ee947-cbb9-4994-a2ae-594605335b14) focused on the study of young brown dwarfs with near infrared spectra. For that, I used a mixture of "traditional" and machine learning tools, in order to understand their most important near infrared spectroscopic features, their population in massive environments, and their accretion properties. During my PhD, I had the privilege to spend 6 months at the European Southern Observatory working with Carlo Manara and Leonardo Testi.

After my PhD I moved to Palermo (Italy), where I am a postdoctoral researcher working with Mario Guarcello on the EWOCS project. [EWOCS](https://westerlund1survey.wordpress.com/) is a JWST and Chandra-based project in which we are studying two of the most massive young clusters in the Milky Way: Westerlund 1 and Westerlund 2. I am particularly working on the characterization of the substellar population of both clusters using Cycle 1 and 3 NIRCam/JWST GO observations. I am also in charge of the data reduction and photometry of the NIRCam observations, and I am also strongly involved in the analysis of MIRI observations for the search and characterization of protoplanetary disks in these extreme environments.

My main interest lies on star and planet formation, particularly on substellar objects, both brown dwarfs and planetary-mass objects. On the one hand, studying the low-mass initial mass function in clusters with different environments testing whether it is universal, and studying the disks around these objects, with a focus on accretion and mass-loss processes, trying to understand what drives the evolution of these disks.

Despite being from the flatest province in Spain, I like spending my free time running in the mountains, and if unfortunately I am stuck in a city, I will be running or cycling there. I also really like reading all kinds of novels and eating sweet food.
